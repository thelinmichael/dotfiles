These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

Config is used on Ubuntu and Fedora.

- Terminal: Kitty
- Window manager: i3 (and Sway, although not actively used due to Zoom screen sharing issues.)
- Terminal multiplexer: tmux
- Editor: Neovim (based on LazyVim, using Kanagawa theme)
- Launcher: rofi
- Shell: zsh
- Bar: polybar (and waybar in Sway)

**Other useful terminal applications**

Applications below may be required by neovim plugins. Run `:checkhealth` to confirm.
```
- fzf (improve terminal ctrl+r, ctrl+t, alt+c)
- ripgrep/rg (alternative to grep)
- fdfind (alternative to find)
- lazydocker (docker) [ld]
- lazygit (git) [lg]
- nethogs (network monitoring)
- pass (password manager)
- eza (replace ls) [ls]
- btop (replace top)
- bat (replace cat)
```
